# A simple application to demonstrate Pragmatic drag and drop

Atlassian has published a new drag-and-drop library
called [Pragmatic drag and drop](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about), which is used
widely in many internal products like Jira, Confluence, etc.

This is a quick demo on how to use it with the "simplest" setup, although you can use pdnd is any other frontend
libraries, I choose React as that's my field for these years. More examples are available in Atlassian [design system website](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/examples).

## Tech stack

- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Pragmatic drag and drop (or pdnd)

## Disclaimer

The logic of `move card` is implemented by `Claude`, meaning I didn't check the whole logic and also not responsible the
cleanness of that piece, :)
But it looks working fine with my drag-and-drop.
